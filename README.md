# 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to my **50 Projects in 50 Days** challenge! üéâ This is a journey to improve my front-end development skills by building a new project each day using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project focuses on a different concept, aiming to solidify my understanding while gaining hands-on experience.
