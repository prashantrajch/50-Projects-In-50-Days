# 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to my **50 Projects in 50 Days** challenge! üéâ This is a journey to improve my front-end development skills by building a new project each day using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project focuses on a different concept, aiming to solidify my understanding while gaining hands-on experience.

**Tech used:** 
- HTML

## Day 5: Blurring Loading
On Day 5, I created a dynamic blurring loading animation. The background image starts out heavily blurred and gradually becomes clear as the page loads. The loading percentage fades out in sync with the background blur. 

### Key Concepts:
- **HTML**: Simple layout for the loading text and background.
- **CSS**: Utilized CSS for background blurring and text opacity transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Created a function to gradually reduce the blur and fade out the loading percentage.
