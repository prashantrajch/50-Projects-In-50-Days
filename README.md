# 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to my **50 Projects in 50 Days** challenge! üéâ This is a journey to improve my front-end development skills by building a new project each day using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project focuses on a different concept, aiming to solidify my understanding while gaining hands-on experience.

## Day 5: Blurring Loading
On Day 5, I created a dynamic blurring loading animation. The background image starts out heavily blurred and gradually becomes clear as the page loads. The loading percentage fades out in sync with the background blur. 

### Key Concepts:
- **HTML**: Simple layout for the loading text and background.
- **CSS**: Utilized CSS for background blurring and text opacity transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Created a function to gradually reduce the blur and fade out the loading percentage.

## Day 6: Scroll Animation
On Day 6, I created a smooth scroll animation effect. As the user scrolls down, boxes slide in from the left and right, adding a dynamic visual experience to the page.

### Key Concepts:
- **HTML**: Structured the content into individual boxes that will animate into view.
- **CSS**: Styled the boxes and added transition effects for a smooth animation.
- **JavaScript**: Used scroll event listeners to trigger the animation based on the position of each box relative to the viewport.

## Day 7: Split Landing Page

On Day 7, I created a **Split Landing Page** featuring two sections: one for Playstation 5 and the other for Xbox Series X. The layout is interactive, expanding when a user hovers over each side to focus on one console. This type of landing page adds a unique, dynamic experience to the website, giving users a clear call to action.

### Key Concepts:
- **HTML & CSS**: Structured the split-page layout with responsive design elements for different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Added event listeners to trigger the CSS transitions for expanding sections on hover.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusted the design for both desktop and mobile viewports.

## Day 8: Form Wave Animation

On Day 8, I worked on a **Form Wave Animation**, focusing on enhancing a basic login form with subtle yet impactful animations. Each letter of the form's label moves in a wave-like pattern when interacting with the input field, creating an engaging and modern user experience.

### Key Concepts:
- **HTML & CSS**: Structured the form with animated labels using transition delays and cubic-bezier for smooth animation.
- **JavaScript**: Manipulated the DOM to split label text into individual characters, allowing for staggered animations.
- **User Interaction**: Focus on improving the form‚Äôs usability by providing visual feedback to users when interacting with input fields.
